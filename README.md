# CV Application
## Description
In this project, i have created a small application where users can input their information and generate a CV/résumé.

## Steps
1. Created a new React project.

2. Think about how to structure the application into components. The application includes:
- Section to add general information like name, email and phone number.
- Section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study and date of study)
- Section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)

3. Include an edit and submit button for each section. The submit button submits your form and display the value of your input fields in HTML elements. The edit button should adds back the input fields, with the previously displayed information as values. In those input fields, you are able to edit and resubmit the content.

4. Create a directory to add components.

5. Include a styles directory to add CSS files.
